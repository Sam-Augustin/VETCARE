<h3>Anthrax</h3>

<p>Anthrax is a potentially fatal disease of all warm-blooded animals, including humans. The disease is caused by a spore-forming bacterium called Bacillus anthracis. Species susceptibility varies. Cattle, sheep and goats are considered highly susceptible and birds highly resistant. In animals, transmission occurs by ingestion and possibly inhalation of spores.</p>

<p>Recent national events have resulted in renewed interest in anthrax. Outbreaks in livestock in 2007 have been reported in California, South Dakota, North Dakota, Texas, Montana and Minnesota.</p>

<h3>Brucellosis</h3>
<p>Brucellosis is a contagious disease of livestock that also affects humans. The disease is also known as contagious abortion or Bang's disease in livestock. In humans, it is known as undulant fever because of the intermittent fever accompanying infection. It is one of the most serious diseases of livestock, because it spreads so rapidly and it is transmissible to humans.</p>

<h3>Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy</h3>
<p>BSE, widely known as "Mad Cow Disease", is a fatal disease of cattle first recognized in the United Kingdom in 1986. Most research suggests an abnormal protein, known as a prion, causes BSE. Scientific evidence shows the same disease agent that causes BSE in cattle also causes the new human disease, variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. BSE spreads in cattle primarily through animal feed containing processed ruminant products. Cattle infected with BSE take 2 to 8 years before showing signs of disease, which include changes in temperament such as nervousness or aggressiveness, and progressive incoordination.</p>

<h3>Bovine Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious bacterial disease caused by Mycobacterium species that usually affects the respiratory system. Animals infected with TB may not show signs for years, and animals that appear healthy may be capable of transmitting infection to other animals.</p>

<h3>Foot and Mouth Disease</h3>
<p>Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) is a debilitating disease affecting all cloven–hoofed animals, including cattle, pigs, and sheep. Clinical signs commonly seen in cattle are drooling, lip smacking, and lameness, caused by blisters (vesicles) on the tongue, dental pad and feet. Sheep and pigs have similar, but often less pronounced, clinical signs.</p>

<h3>Johne's Disease</h3>
<p>Johne's disease is caused by a bacterium (Mycobacterium paratuberculosis) that infects the intestinal tract of ruminants. Cattle are usually infected as calves but do not show clinical signs until three or more years of age. The disease develops slowly and eventually kills the infected animal. There is no effective treatment. Cattle with advanced Johne's disease have chronic diarrhea and continually lose weight despite having good appetites.</p>

<h3>Rabies</h3>
<p>Rabies is a viral disease affecting all mammals that is invariably fatal if not treated. Cases are diagnosed in livestock, as well as in dogs, cats, and wildlife.</p>

<h3>Screwworm</h3>
<p>Screwworms are fly larvae (maggots) that feed on living flesh. These parasites can infect any warm-blooded animal. Screwworms enter wounds as small as an insect bite and feed on living tissue in the area. If untreated, screwworm infestations can be fatal. In the US, Screwworm is a Foreign Animal Disease reportable within 24 hours of diagnosis. Screwworms have most recently entered the U.S. in dogs that have been imported from areas of the world where the flies are endemic.</p>

<h3>Trichomonosis</h3>
<p>Bovine trichomonosis (aka trichomoniasis or trich) is a venereal disease of cattle caused by the protozoa Tritrichomonas foetus. The organism lives in the folds of the prepuce and internal sheath in bulls, and colonizes the vagina, cervix, uterus and oviducts of cows. It causes abortion and extended calving seasons. Bulls will remain persistently infected and spread infection from cow to cow during natural service; however, cows generally clear infection after two to three heat cycles.</p>

    <p>
    Bacillus anthrachis causes Anthrax 
    </p>
    <p>Hosts: Anthrax is a soil-borne bacterial infection of domestic animals, wild animals and human</p>
    
    (c) Center for disease control (CDC) Atlanta, Georgia	 
                                        
     
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>WARNING:  Notifiable disease! If you suspect an animal has anthrax, you must inform the authorities immediately. Animals suspected of having died of anthrax should not be opened.
     
    
    Anthrax is a soil-borne bacterial infection of domestic animals, wild animals and human. It is caused by the spore-forming organism Bacillus anthracis.
    
    Hosts: It is most common in wild and domestic herbivores - cattle, sheep, goats, camels, horse, pig, dog, antelopes, zebra - but it also occurs in humans exposed to tissue from infected animals, contaminated animal products, or directly to anthrax spores. It doesn't affect chickens but it is common in ostriches.
    
    Distribution: Anthrax occurs all over the world. It is more common in warm climates as spore formation only occurs when the temperature is between 20@ and 40@C, the humidity is over 60% and the pH is above 6.0.
    
    Under such conditions spore formation occurs rapidly, leading to the contamination of soil and water, where the spore may survive for years; up to 30 years in some cases. Spores are formed in the presence of oxygen. Within a carcass the organisms rapidly die. Only when they are exposed to air and oxygen do they form spores.
    </P>
     
    <h4>Mode of spread</h4>
    <p>The disease is transmitted through pastures which are contaminated by the spores. The animals may be forced during drought to graze on short grass which may be contaminated by the infected soil. Anthrax spores can remain infective in soil for many years. During this time they are a potential source of infection to grazing livestock. Grazing animals may become infected when they ingest sufficient numbers of these spores from the soil.

    <p><ul>
        <li>Feed contaminated with bone, or other meal from infected animals, can serve as a source of infection for livestock, as can hay that is heavily contaminated with infected soil.</li>
    <li>Infection is influenced by communal watering points. Water holes used by different species of animals are known to be a source of infection.</li>
        <li>Flooding may expose previously buried spores and agricultural practices may do the same.</li>
            <li>Tissues of infected animals may be moved by rats and carrion eaters and transfer infection.</li>
                <li>Raw or poorly cooked contaminated meat is a source of infection for carnivores and omnivores, including humans.</li>
                    <li>In animals, infection is usually by eating infected grass, less commonly by breathing spore infested dust  or through open wounds. In cattle, sheep and goats infection is nearly always by mouth.</li>
                        <li>In camels and horses biting flies may transmit infection and this may explain the swellings sometimes seen on the body and legs of these species.</li>
                            <li>Humans are fairly resistant and are infected after an occupational hazard affecting workers in tanneries. The workers may inhale spores and suffer an acute fatal pneumonic form of anthrax. Cutaneous anthrax is common among people who carry meat and other animal products from infected carcass. The bacteria can survive for several years in livestock products such as hides, wool and bones.</li>
                                <li>Infection in humans is usually via skin abrasions or by inhalation. People handling wool, hides and skins are mostly at risk. Eating infected meat obviously carries a major risk, although rapid cooking quickly destroys the organism before the highly resistant spores have a chance to develop. There has been cases reported in Kenya where people have eaten meat from infected animals and died shortly afterwards.  </li>

    <h4>Signs of Anthrax</h4>
    <p>Depending on the route of infection, host factors, and potentially strain specific factors, anthrax can have several different clinical presentations.
    </p>
    <p>The anthrax bacillus produces a lethal toxin in the animals which causes accumulation of fluid (oedema=swellings) and tissue damage, resulting in death from shock and kidney failure.
    </p>
    <p>In very severe forms, there is a short illness and this makes the disease difficult to treat. The animal develops high fever, difficult breathing followed by convulsion, collapse and death.
    </p>
    <p>In ruminants such as cattle, sheep and goats, the symptoms of anthrax are very sudden and severe, with death occurring within minutes to hours. There is staggering, high fever, rapid breathing, trembling, collapse, and a few convulsive movements, followed by death. Usually the animal is found dead, with bloody discharges from body openings. Rigor mortis is often absent or incomplete, with marked bloating and rapid decomposition. The blood is dark and thickened and fails to clot readily. If by mistake the carcase is opened it will be noticed that the spleen is greatly enlarged and the pulp soft and tarry.
    </p>
    <p>In severe forms, the disease would last about 2 - 3 days before death. The animal will appear depressed, listless and have high fever. The mucus membranes in the eyes and gums are congested and hemorrhagic(showing blood). There is difficulty in breathing caused by edematous (watery) swelling in the throat.
    </p>
    <p>In less severe cases, some animals may survive for 1 week and others will recover. In dogs, humans, horses and pigs, the disease is usually less severe. Sometimes there may be swelling in the lower neck, chest and shoulders, especially in animals such as pigs, camels and horses.
    </p>
    <p>In both severe and less severe cases, affected cows may abort and have a reduction in milk production. The milk will be blood stained or appear yellowish in color. Infection in the alimentary tract may cause dysentery.
    </p>
     
    <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
    <p>In any case of sudden death anthrax must be suspected and a veterinarian informed so that a diagnosis can be made. Bloat, lightning strike, blackquarter, snakebite, and plant poisoning can also cause sudden death.
    </p>
    <p>It is very risky for unqualified laboratory personnel to take samples of the disease. The sampling procedure should be carried out by qualified laboratory personnel only.
    </p>
    <p>Blood from nose, mouth or anus is a tell-tale sign of Anthrax. It may be a lot or a few drops. It can also be absent.
    </p>
    <p>The vet will stain a blood smear or smear from a lymph node, abdominal fluid or subcutaneous sweling and examine it under the microscope to give a rapid diagnosis. Only if the result is negative should the post mortem examination proceed. Under the microscope the organism appear as large square ended rods with a pink capsule.

    <h4>Prevention and Control</h4>
    <p>Prevention and control requires a strict adherence to veterinary regulations to prevent and minimize the spread of the disease among livestock and humans.
    </p>
    <p>Anthrax can be a very severe food borne pathogen and must at all means be prevented from entering any food or feed.
    </p>
    <p>The carcass of any animal suspected to have died of Anthrax should not be opened but must instead be burnt or buried at a depth of at least 2 meters, and the surrounding area burnt and treated with 10% formalin or 10% caustic soda to prevent contamination of the environment. The surrounding area where the carcass has been burned should be fenced off.
    </p>
        <h5>Signs after death</h5>
    <ul>
    <li>Carcass is stiff and bloated</li>
        <li>Decomposition is rapid</li>
            <li>Bleeding from ears, mouth, nose, anus or vagina</li>
                <li>Blood is dark and does not clot</li>

    <h5>Contaminated beddings, premises and feeds should be destroyed or thoroughly disinfected.</h5>
    <ul>
    <li>Vaccination of all livestock at risk should be done annually as a legal requirement. The avirulent live Sterne- strain spore vaccine, which has lost its ability to form capsules, is available in most countries and offers annual protection. In Kenya a commercially available product called "Blanthax" is used for the annual vaccinations against Black quarter and Anthrax.<li>
        <li>Quarantine should be imposed in all infected areas to prevent movement of animals into and out of such areas. Such quarantine should be not lifted until at least 6 months after disinfection procedures are complete.</li>
            <li>The appropriate authorities must be notified.</li>
                <li>General sanitary measures must be observed by all persons handling diseased animals, both for their own safety and to prevent spread of the disease.</li>
                    <li>Scavengers, including dogs, jackals and birds, must be controlled and kept away from dead animals to minimise spread of infection.</li>
                        <li>Remove healthy animals from the vicinity where an animal has died.</li>
     
    </ul>
    <h5>Recommended treatment</h5>
    
    Bacillus anthracis is susceptible to antibiotics such as penicillin, streptomycin and tetracyclines and these may be used by a qualified veterinarian either to treat infected animals in the unlikely event that they are seen alive, or to give protection to in-contact animals. This is then followed by vaccination about 7-10 days later.

        <h3><center>2.Bloat</center></h3>
        <p>When the belly of an animal suddenly seems to blow up like a balloon, and the animal has trouble walking - often groans in pain - it is said to have contracted bloat. This happens very often with sudden changes in feed such as at the onset of rains when a lot of fresh new grass is suddenly available. Many animals can bloat at the same time, so when the rains start it is good to have remedies nearby such as cooking oil or detergent such as OMO or similar.
            </p>
            <p>Feeding half a bottle of cooking oil to an adult cow is usually sufficient for it to make a full recovery within half an hour if caught in time. If no cooking oil is available people have also been successful treating with a handful of OMO on a bottle of water.  However if too much time passes and the animal no longer is standing the only hope is to cut a hole in the stomach on the left side where the swelling is at its highest point. For proper instructions please link to nutritional problems.

    <div>
        <h3><center>3.Enterotoxemia</center></h3>
        <p>Also called dysentery is a very serious disease - especially for young animals. If you have the bacteria in your herd it can be the cause of death of all the young animals.
        <p>
            Enterotoxaemia is caused by the bacterium Clostridium perfringens, an organism which occurs worldwide in the soil and in the gastrointestinal tract of animals. It is characterized by the ability to produce potent toxins (poisons). The bacteria are also capable of forming spores which survive for very long periods in soil. Five types have been identified, the most important of which are B, C and D.
            </p>
           <p> The spores of Clostridium perfringens Types B, C and D are found in soil and faeces of normal animals in areas where disease is prevalent as well as in the intestinal contents of infected sheep. Their presence in the intestinal tract of normal animals is important because they are able to form the focus for a fatal infection as and when conditions alter to allow their rapid multiplication.
            </p>
            <h4>Types B and C (Dysentery)<h4>
            <p>These types cause severe enteritis (stomach infection), dysentery (very severe diarrhea, often with blood and mucous), toxaemia (blood poisoning) and high mortality in young lambs, calves, pigs and foals. 
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Types B and C both produce the highly necrotizing and lethal beta toxin, which is responsible for severe intestinal damage.  Adult cattle, sheep and goats can be affected by enterotoxaemia caused by Type C. </li>
                <li>Lamb Dysentery occurs in lambs up to three weeks of age and is caused by Type B.</li>
                    <li>Calf Enterotoxaemia is caused by Types B and C in well fed calves up to one month of age.</li> 
                        <li>Pig Enterotoxaemia occurs during the first few days of life and is caused by Type C. </li>
                            <li>Foal Enterotoxaemia occurs during the first week of life and is caused by Type B.</li>
                                <li>Struck is caused by Type C in adult sheep, while Goat Enterotoxaemia in adult goats is also caused by Type C.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Signs of Enteroxamia (Dysentery)</h4>
            <p>Lamb dysentery is an acute disease of lambs less than three weeks old. Many die before symptoms are seen. Others stop suckling, become listless, have a foetid (foul smelling), blood-tinged diarrhoea and die within a few days. 
            </p>
            <p>In calves there is acute diarrhoea, dysentery, abdominal pain and convulsions. Death may occur within a few hours, but less severe cases may survive for a few days and occasionally recovery may occur.
            </p>
            <p>Struck is characterized by sudden death in adult sheep.
            </p>
             
            
            <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
            <p>Typical sign in all cases is a bloody inflammation of the guts (haemorrhagic enteritis) with ulceration of the mucosa.  Under the microscope stained smears of the gut contents reveal large numbers of gram positive rod-shaped bacteria.
            
            </p>
            
            <h4>Control and Prevention</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Because the disease is so severe, treatment is ineffective.  Oral administration of antibiotics may be helpful in some cases.</li>
                <li>The disease in lambs is best controlled by vaccination of the pregnant dam during the last third of pregnancy, initially 2 vaccinations one month apart and annually thereafter.</li>
                    <li>When outbreaks occur in newborn animals from unvaccinated dams, antiserum, if available, should be administered immediately after birth.</li>
                        <li>Type D  (Pulpy Kidney Disease)</li>
                            <li>This type causes Pulpy Kidney Disease of sheep.  </li> 
                                <li>It occurs world wide and may occur in animals of any age, but occurs most commonly in 3 - 12 week old lambs and in fattening lambs 6 - 12 months old.  Single lambs are more susceptible than twins. Mortality is usually 100%.</li>
                                    <li>It is caused by the rapid multiplication of the organism in the small intestine and the subsequent absorption of the epsilon toxin, which is produced by the organism in the intestine.</li>
                                        <li>Lambs on lush grazing or being fed grain in feedlots, are particularly at risk.</li>
                                        <h4>Pulpy Kidney disease<h4>
                                        <p>Pulpy Kidney Disease is peracute (very fast killing) with most cases being found dead. Those that are observed before death show hyperaesthesia (excessive reaction to being touched and other stimuli), staggering progressing to lying down, with its head twisted back over the back, intermittent convulsions, occasional diarrhoea and death. Affected animals do not recover.
                                            </p>

        <h3><center>4.Liver fluke</center></h3>
        <p>The life cycle of liver flukes involves a snail, which acts as an intermediate host. If there is no snail there will be no flukes. The snail involved requires still, stagnant water to survive; swift running water does not suit it. Swamps, ponds, lakes with a marshy edge and pools of water edged by vegetation are danger zones for grazing animals.
            </p>
<p>Cattle, sheep and goats are mainly affected, although other animals such as donkeys, horses, and many species of wildlife such as buffalo can also be infested. Humans can also be infested with liver flukes.
 </p>
<p>As the name suggests, the liver fluke attacks the liver.
 </p>

<h4>Three forms of illness can occur:</h4>
 <ol>
<li>Flukes can cause sudden death, from liver failure and from internal bleeding, when large numbers of immature flukes migrate through and cause damage to liver tissue. This clinical picture is common in young sheep.</li>
    <li>Flukes can also cause a chronic wasting disease accompanied by anaemia and oedema (swelling). The oedema is typically located on the lower jaws ("bottle jaw") and on the lower part of the belly. This is the most common picture in cattle.</li>
        <li>iver lesions due to flukes are the causative factor in Infectious Necrotic Hepatitis (Black Disease), predominantly a disease of sheep aged between 2 - 4 years, but aso occurs in young cattle. Specific bacteria (Clostridia) multiply in liver lesions caused by migrating flukes and release toxins. Sudden death is the result.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Life cycle of liver flukes</h4>
<p>Knowledge of the life cycle of the liver fluke is an aid in understanding how to control the disease.
 </p>
<p>The intermediate host snails for Fasciola gigantica and Fasciola hepatica may differ but in other respects the life cycle is the same.
 </p>
 <ul>
<li>The life cycle begins with the eggs of the fluke which mature in the bile ducts in the liver, pass down the ducts, into the gut and are excreted with the faeces.</li>
    <li>Once outside in the environment, which must contain water, the eggs hatch, releasing an active stage, called miracidia. Temperature and time are critical in the early stages for the development of the miracidia- above 5-6 C, and best between 25-24C. Miracidia must find a suitable snail within 24-30 hours or they will die.</li>
        <li>The miracidia either actively invade a host snail or are eaten by a host snail.</li>
            <li>They then hatch in the snail's gut and the next stage develops in the tissues of the snail.</li>
                <li>5 to 8 weeks later another stage emerges from the snail and form resistant cysts attached to herbage or grass, where they are eaten by the final host - cattle, sheep, goat or other herbivores.</li>
                    <li>Once ingested by the sheep or cow the immature fluke invade the gut wall, travel to the liver where they cause extensive damage to the liver tissue until they reach the bile ducts. Here they mature into adult flukes and start to lay eggs and the life cycle begins again. It takes 10-12 weeks from infestation until eggs start to be laid and shed with the faeces.</li>
                    </ul>    
                    <p>Mature flukes are long lived and sheep and cattle may be carriers for years.</p>

<h4>Prevention - Control - Treatment</h4>

<ul>
<li>Control measures include treatment against flukes in affected animals and the prevention of livestock access to snail-infested pastures. In practice only the first of these is used in most cases.</li>
    <li>Fencing off snail sites makes sense when the areas are small. Preventing livestock from drinking from ponds and stagnant water where they can feed from peri-aquatic vegetation infested by liver fluke cysts is an important measure. This an bee achieved by providing adequately maintained water troughs for watering of livestock with a good concreted area around them to prevent the area from becoming muddied. </li>
        <li>Drainage of pastures and paddocks is the best permanent solution, but may be costly.</li>
            <li>Grazing livestock in Africa are more likely to contract liver flukes infestations during the dry season than in the wet, as during the dry season they enter snail infested flood zones and marshes which constitute dry season grazing reserves. In such situations it is advisable to keep animals out of such swamps for as long as possible so that fewer viable cysts are present on the herbage.</li>
                <li>When entry to the swamp is unavoidable then the older cattle should go in first as they are much more resistant than the younger cattle, followed, last of all, by the most susceptible sheep and goats.</li>
                    <li>The prophylactic administration of specific drugs against flukes to those animals most at risk, can considerably reduce occurrence of the disease.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Treatment</h4>

<h5>The following drugs are effective in the treatment of Liver Flukes:</h5>
<ol>

        <h3><center>5.Snake bite</center></h3>
        <p>Lastly also snake bite can be a cause of sudden death. If the snake is seen and identified, an antivenom can be tried.
            </p>
<p>If the cause is diagnosed in time people have also had luck with giving electric shocks : Ask a car owner to come quickly with the starter cables, leave the car running while giving a quick shock with the positive and negative ends placed on each side of the bite wound. This works on people as well!
